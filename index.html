                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>I grew up in Jurmala, Latvia in a small village called Buļļuciems. I started my career in marine engineering after I graduated from Latvian Maritime academy. Marine engineering includes doing regular maintenance on ships propulsion system as well as taking care of other systems and equipment. It is so interesting that on one vessel there are many people from different countries and they all work together as a team. I travelled all around the world visiting many places like Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, Coatzacoalcos in Mexico, most south coast of United States of America and many more countries in different continents. Every visited place has different culture and unique things that are only there. </p>
                <p>After several years I decided to change my career and try something new. IT specialist sounded very interesting with perspective opportunities and options of what to do. To be an IT specialist you have to creative in order to create something new as well as realising ideas of different people. So I decided to start in Web Development.</p>

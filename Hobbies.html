                In this section I will talk about hobbies and interests. My favourite hobby is linked with my work and that is travelling! I will list in order main reasons why i love travelling:
                <ol>
                    <li>One of my favourite reasons for having travel as a hobby is being able to immerse myself in different countries and culture.
                        Even spending a week in another country gives me more understanding and appreciation of a culture than never having visited.
                        When I can talk to people, live alongside them, shop in the places they do and feel out of my comfort zone in their world, it begins to help me realise some of what is important.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I agree that the only way to truly comprehend the amazing places on Earth is to see and feel them with your own eyes. In that you get a completely different understanding of something and you can make your own concept of what it is and how it is really.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whilst travelling it is possible to meet new people and make friends aswell and my phone book has the numbers of a few that have become more than just people to me.
                        Whilst most don’t become lifelong friends, the colourful characters we meet on the road become part of the stories we tell for a lifetime.
                        To all of you, and the hundreds of others i have met, thank you.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>If we are talking about interests or things that i love then i will mention a few of them:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Animals => I'm an animal lover. I cannot imagine my life without a pet. All my life i have had a pet at home. With almost no effort at all, pets manage to bring so much joy into our lives. They make us laugh, comfort us when we’re sick or upset, and are always there for us no matter what. Not everyone understands the bond between human and beast, though, or even realises how much pets do for their owners. We take a look at ten of the benefits of having a furry friend. Also there are a lot of benefits of having one, such as if it is a dog then all dogs needs daily walks in order to stay happy and healthy and so do we. Cats and dogs both make great companions - they will always be waiting for you to come home and they will be happy to lend an ear about the awful day you had.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Watching sport => In my case i am watching ice-hockey. I used to play it aswell. Watching sports through TV also gives me a spark to my motivation and start doing something instead of sitting. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Outdoors => I like being outdoor all the time. My average daily length exceeds up to 3 hours per day. I live at a peaceful neighbourhood and i dont live far away from both sea and river with big forest terrain, where i can freely walk.
                    </li>

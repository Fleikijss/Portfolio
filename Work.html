                <p>A marine engineer is a professional who has studied marine engineering and is responsible for the operation, maintenance and repair of all major mechanical and engineered equipment onboard a ship.
                    There are several mechanical systems that help in the operations of any vessel like the propulsion mechanics, electricity and power generation system, lubrication, fuel systems, water distillation, lighting and air conditioning system etc.
                    <br>A marine engineer have to be a social because on a vessel there may be people from different countries and cultures. Also marine engineers have to be emotionally stable so that they are can remain calm and focused in distress situations for example when there is fire onboard or M.O.B. (Man overboard).
                    <br>In this picture you can see main propulsion of a ship. This is a two-stroke inline engine with 6 cylinders.

                <p>Some of the important duties that people who have done marine engineering perform are:<br> Monitoring and maintenance of mechanical systems – Engineers of each rank on board ship is allocated specific machinery and systems for maintenance and monitoring purpose.
                    Machinery systems are divided among all engineers and it is the duty of each engineer to ensure his machinery is running at all times. Marine engineers are also required to look after the machinery on deck.
                    <br> This picture includes some important parameters of an engine (in this case Diesel generator) which  are to maintained, monitored and recorded in a log book.
